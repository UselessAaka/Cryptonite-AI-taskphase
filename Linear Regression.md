## Linear Regression
 Linear regression is a machine learning model which gives us a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It basically helps us to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables already given.
 There are twwo types of linear regression:-
#### 1) Simple linear regression
This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is:

X= θ<sub>0</sub>+ θ<sub>1</sub>X       

where:

Y is the dependent variable or predicted value

X is the independent variable

θ<sub>0</sub> is the intercept

θ<sub>1</sub> is the slope
#### 2) Multiple Linear Regression
This involves more than one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for multiple linear regression is:

Y=θ<sub>0</sub> + θ<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + θ<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + ....... +θ<sub>n</sub>X<sub>n</sub>                  

where:

Y is the dependent variable

X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,..... are the independent variables

θ<sub>0</sub> is the intercept

θ<sub>1</sub>,θ<sub>2</sub>,......,θ<sub>n</sub> are the slopes
